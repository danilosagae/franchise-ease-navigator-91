# Assets Directory

After building your React application with `npm run build`, copy all files from the `dist` directory into this folder.

The theme will automatically load:
- `index.css` - Main stylesheet
- `index.js` - Main JavaScript bundle

All other assets (images, fonts, etc.) should be placed in appropriate subfolders within this directory.
